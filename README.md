spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/notesdb?retryWrites=true&w=majority


Run the Spring Boot App

mvn spring-boot:run


The backend will start at http://localhost:8080.

Open Frontend

Open index.html in a browser (or serve it using any static server).

Make sure the API URL in app.js points to your backend:

const API_URL = "http://localhost:8080/api/notes";
